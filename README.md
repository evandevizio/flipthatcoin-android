# flipthatcoin-android
An Android version of *FlipThatCoin*, the dual-mode coin flipping tool.

## Summary
This is a basic coin flipping simulator with two modes: "single", and "best 2 of 3".
The software was written using Java that I based on C# source code from the original *FlipThatCoin*. 
Features responsive graphical user interface to support a variety of screen sizes.

To run, you can import the project into your IDE and then deploy the app or build an APK file (I compiled with Android SDK version 28).

Modes:
---
* **Single**: The player can flip the coin indefinitely.
* **Best of 3**: Heads and tails are counted to determine a winner. Majority wins the round, and likewise for game.
